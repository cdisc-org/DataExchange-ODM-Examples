This is an example (under development) of the "Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale" (C-SSRS)" questionnaire.
Source has been: https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Suicide-Risk-Assessment-C-SSRS-Lifeline-Version-2014.pdf

The example uses "matrix" style questions and repeating ItemGroups, 
and a "WorkflowDef" element to describe the workflow within the questionnaire (we will NOT use "CollectionExceptionConditionOID" for "skip questions)

TODO: also add "ClinicalData" section, which may come with "NullFlavor" for questions that were skipped due to the workflow.
